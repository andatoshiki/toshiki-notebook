# CIS105: Computer Applications & Information Systems Lect. 6 Pt. 1

## Chapter 6: System Software

### 6.1: System Software Overview

System Software:

-   Enables the Operating System
-   Controls memory, input and output, and manages filing system
-   Runs essential processes automatically
-   Controls the physical hardware so that applications software can work
-   If your computer is running, your system software is working

### 6.2: Starting the Computer

What happens when you press the power button:

-   System searches for Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
-   Firmware, locates computer hardware
-   SS loads the platform (OS) into the computer’s memory: Booting
-   Powering up the computer for the first time: Cold Boot
-   Restarting a computer: Warm Boot
-   Computer will ask for login and load your profile
-   Preferences, themes, styles, and types of resources set up by the user
-   Registry loads settings made by the user
-   Screen savers, appearance, and personalizations

### 6.3: Administering Application Software

-   When a user clicks on an application, the application info moves from the hard drive to RAM (Random Access Memory)
-   SS and OS make sure application software works correctly

### 6.4: Memory Management

-   Computer memory allocation can be compared to a farmer allocating water for crops
-   Virtual memory: The technique of breaking large files down from the hard drive into smaller, more manageable files that fit in RAM
-   Smaller files called Pages
-   If the pages exceed RAM storage, OS will store temporary copies of pages to hard drive
-   Swap Files: When pages exceed RAM storage, OS swaps pages between hard drive and RAM
    Ask yourself: Does your business need new computers or new computer parts?
-   New computer: $800-1500
-   Upgraded RAM: $50-$200
-   Upgraded Hard Drive:$40-$100

### 6.5: Interfacing and Utilities

SS in the form of an OS must serve as a translator for both the computer and end user

-   Monitor: displays and renders output an end user can understand
-   GUI
-   Icon: A small pictogram on the desktop that a user clicks with a mouse
-   Window: A GUI unto its own
-   Device Drivers: allow input and output devices to operate properly
-   The background displayed on the monitor is considered the desktop environment, or "desktop" for short
-   Active Window: the window that the user is currently using

### 6.6: File Management Systems

Based on a hierarchy of folders that contain computer files. File management systems are searchable and provide information on files:

-   File Name
-   File Creation Date
-   File Modification Date
-   Location of the file
-   Who created or modified a file
-   File size
-   In business, it is important to establish your file management system early

### 6.7: System Software Utilities

-   Tracks: concentric circular bands
-   Sectors: Tracks that are separated into wedges
-   Defragmentation: Organizes + and – charges to the innermost tracks of the disk to reduce the amount of time it takes the R/W arm to find the info

### 6.8: Antivirus Utilities

Antivirus Utilities: System software that identifies known viruses to block them from entering and infecting a computer system

-   Utilizes a database of known viruses to cross reference against each incoming file
-   Subscription service: Norton Antivirus and McAfee VirusScan

### 6.9: System Updates

-   To compensate for OS inadequacies, OS offer a system software utility called system update
-   Patches sent from Microsoft (or Mac) via the Internet to a user’s computer

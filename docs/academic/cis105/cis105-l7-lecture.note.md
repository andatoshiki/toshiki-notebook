## Chapter 7: Green Business Computing

### 7.1: Green Business Computing

-   Burning fossil fules creates carbon dioxide which builds up and slows the escape of heat into space, called the "greenhouse effect".
-   **NASA** predicts Earth's surface temperature will increase by 2.5 to 10.4 Fahrenheit by the year 2100. The concern is that human societies and natural ecosystems may not adapt quickly enough.
-   The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in charge of creating and maintaining climate computer models that are used to predict weather admit they are flawed and unreliable.
-   Who's right, ASA or NCAR?

### 7.2: Climate Change

-   Whether global warming exists is a discussion that requires critical thoughtfullnesswith a minimum of passion.
-   It is virtually impossible to not come across terminologies like "green" or challenges, and potential sustainable solutions have gained traction and must be dealt with.
-   Regardless of differing views, climate change has gained diffusion and acceptance as an acknowledged problem that will drive business for many years to come. Environmental responsibility and global governance is simply the right things to do.

### 7.3: IT Challenges and Opportunities

-   Chief technology officers (in charge of all business computing assets) meed to be concerned with overall energy costs associated with computing systems.
-   Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)
    -   Started by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2006.
    -   Managed by the Green Electronics Council (GEC)
    -   Easy to use online tool

### 7.4: EPEAT Criteria

EPEAT evaluates electronic products relative to 51 environmental criteria, 23 required and 28 optional. Computer manufacturers that meet a certain criteria are awarded a gold, silver, or bronze star allowing the consumer to differentiate products.

-   **Reduction or elimination of environmentally sensitive materials**. Computers contain potentially harmful chemicals like cadmium, mercury, and chromium. EPEAT Encourages manufacturers to reduce or eliminate them altogether.

-   **Materials Selection** informs the consumer of the percentage of recycled plastic and offers a declaration of percentage of renewable/bio-based plastic material content.

-   **Design for End of Life** informs consumers about special handling needs for disposing of their product when it no longer useful.

-   **Product Longevity/Life Cycle Extension** encourages manufacturers to make extended warranties available so their product lasts longer or available to be upgraded.

-   **End of Life Management** asks manufacturers to take their product back at the end of the product’s life, at no cost to the consumer.

-   **Corporate Performance** means a manufacturer demonstrates a sound corporate environmental policy throughout their business.

-   **Packaging** criteria requires manufacturers to reduce or eliminate intentionally added toxins in packaging.

-   **Energy Conservation** asks manufacturers to adopt the government’s Energy Star® specifications.

EPEAT criteria seems difficult and expensive for a gold star, so why would manufacturers be willing to comply? Had you ever heard of EPEAT? Did you base your last computer purchase on EPEAT criteria? If you were aware of EPEAT, would you pay more just to be green? What if your business pays significantly more for EPEAT computers and your competitor doesn’t, did they get an edge?

### 7.5: **Energy Star® Specifications**

-   Started in 1772 as a voluntary labeling program to identify and promote energy efficient products.

-   Energy Star® claims that if every computer in the United States met Energy Star® requirements, the savings in energy costs alone will grow to about $2 billion each year and greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by the the equivalent of that from 2 million cars.

-   In many instances, Energy Star® computers are more expensive to purchase but are far more efficient and cost effective in the long run

### 7.6: The Green PC

A Green PC is a personal computer that is environmentally friendly and includes the following:

-   Energy-efficient power supplies

-   Includes processors that consume minimum amounts of electricity

-   Attempt to do away with or minimize environmentally harmful components

-   Makes use of aluminum or plastic parts from recycled materials

The most important factor in a Green PC is energy efficiency

### 7.7: **Modes**

-   **Active Use**: The computer is on and being use

-   **Sleep Mode**: Low power after a designated period of time

-   **Standby Mode** (Off): Turns off after designated period of time

### 7.8: Green Business Computing Plan

Based on the idea that businesses can be environmentally friendly, more profitable, and socially responsible.

-   Organizational policies and procedures

-   Best Practice considerations

-   Long term, sustainable considerations

-   Reduction of power usage and paper consumption

-   Recycling policies and procedures

-   Used computer software and hardware disposal

-   EPEAT and Energy Star® compliance

-   Green PC purchasing recommendations

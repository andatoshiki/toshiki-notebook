The packets arrive at the receiving computer and must be reassembled correctly to guarantee the receiving computer gets a file that will work (not corrupted).</li><li>User Datagram Packets: Break large files into packets, but unlike TCP/IP, allows a user to use the incoming file.</li></ul><h3 id="_8-4-network-operating-systems" tabindex="-1">8.4: Network Operating Systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-4-network-operating-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;8.4: Network Operating Systems&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A Network Operating System (NOS) is similar to a stand-alone platform but responsible for much more:</p><ul><li>Automatic hardware detection.
